# Compyte

This is an unfinished project where I'm building a Gmail style autocompletion feature that uses ChatGPT for the completions.

## Quick Start

1. Add you OpenAI API key to `OPENAI_API_KEY`

```bash
$ export OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX
```

2. Launch the server

```bash
$ python3 server.py
```

3. Go to http://localhost:5000
